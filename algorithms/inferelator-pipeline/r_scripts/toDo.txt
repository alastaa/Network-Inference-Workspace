Hi Alex,

Here is a list of things we need to get done for the release code:

Test Code:
DONE- make sure code works for DREAM2,3,4 (i.e. it should not crash b/c
dream3 and 4 have no double ko challenge)
This could easily be done by adding if statements wr necessary (I've
done it for the most part except for your recent changes)
- make sure code works for elastic net with weights != 0
This could be done by making sure that the data structures we are
using have a list for each l2 weight (should work for lnet code as is
but need testing/debuging)

Add functionality:
DONE - add a reader for DREAM2/3/4 data
This should be provided as three scripts: createDREAMNdata.R wr
N=2,3,4 (2 and 3 should be the same, 4 a bit different)
the scripts read in the dream data and produce required .RData
- add a param for producing plots
when set as true should produce a few plots:
prec vs. recall (including a text of actuall AUC on plot)
roc curve (including a text of actuall AUC on plot)
prediction quality if DREAM4 run (i don't know what plot would be the
best, maybe a box plot..)

Expand readme file:
- readme file that get ppl started
Explain about required packages
Review data structures (colMap, ratios, clusterStack)

Let me know if you think something is missing in this list.
Do what you can.

Cheers,
Aviv
