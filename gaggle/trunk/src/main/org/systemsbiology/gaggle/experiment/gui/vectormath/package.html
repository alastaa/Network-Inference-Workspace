<h2>Vector Arithmetic</h2>

This package provides an implementation of vectors of floating-point numbers and
simple vector operations such as add, subtract, scalar multiplication, normalization,
and dot product. Two key features are:

<ul>
<li> Vectors are implemented as wrappers around another data structure that provides
the storage. This allows the user to gain the utility of vector operations without
having to repackage their data.

<li> This package offers both read-only and normal read-write vector views of the data.
</ul>

The point of this package is to avoid repetitive implementations of basic operations.
Instead of writing a tedious and error-prone for loop every time you want to operate
on a sequence of floating point numbers, simply wrap the data as a vector object and use
a strongly tested vector operation. It's easy to do, much more reliable, and doesn't
require any data copying.<p>

Since this package is designed for convenience, no attempt has been made to make it
ultra-high performance, although it should not be much slower than a direct for loop.
If you want to do lots of computations and performance is critical, then you should
either find a way to extend this package or use something different. For example, it
wouldn't be too hard to define a special implementation for arrays that would be
exactly the same as direct for loops - this need simply hasn't come up yet.

Note that this package is not null-safe; in other words, trying to take the dot product
with a null vector object will throw a run-time NullPointerException.

<h3> Creating a new vector</h3>

Vectors are not constructed directly by the user, but are created by the MathVectorFactory
class.<p>

If your data is stored in a simple data structure such as a floating point array, you
can create a MathVector directly with a single call to the appropriate MathVectorFactory
method. For example:<p>

<code>
double[] myData = new double[10];<br>
MathVector myVector = MathVectorFactory.makeVector(myData);<br>
</code><p>

Once you have a MathVector object, you can immediately do vector operations like
normalizing the vector or taking the dot product with another vector. See the class
documentation for specifics.<p>

Remember that the MathVector object is only a wrapper around your existing data. In other
words, making changes to the MathVector actually changes the underlying double array.
If this isn't what you want, then either use a read-only vector (see below), or use the
<code>copy()</code> method of MathVector to create a completely new data object.<p>

<hr>

If your data is instead stored in objects not known to MathVectorFactory, then you
need to create an interface to your data. VectorDataProvider is an interface that
defines the three needed methods:<p>

<code>
int size();<br>
double getQuick(int index);<br>
void setQuick(int index, double value);<br>
</code><p>

The method <code>size()</code> returns the number of elements, while the
<code>getQuick</code> and <code>setQuick</code> methods are used to retrieve and set the
value of the corresponding element. As the names suggest,
<code>getQuick</code> and <code>setQuick</code> are not range-checked operations; the
vector arithmetic package does all the range checking required.<p>

To view your data as a vector, all you need to do is define a simple class that implements
VectorDataProvider and accesses your data, or rewrite your class to implement
VectorDataProvider and its three methods. For example, suppose your data was a
java.util.List of Measurement objects, where each Measurement object contained the
measured value and its associated error, i.e.:<p>

<pre>
public class Measurement {
    public double value;
    public double error;
}
</pre><p>

Here would be the full implementation of an appropriate data provider for the vector
of measured values:<p>

<pre>
public class MeasurementVectorDataProvider implements VectorDataProvider {

    private List dataSource;
    
    public MeasurementVectorDataProvider(List l) {dataSource = l;}
    
    public int size() {return dataSource.size();}
    public double getQuick{int i) {return ((Measurement)dataSource.get(i)).value;}
    public void setQuick(int i, double value) {
        Measurement m = (Measurement)dataSource.get(i);
        m.value = value;
    }
}
</pre><p>

The data provider simply implements a vector view of the data in terms of the
operations that make sense for the underlying data structure.
Obvious extensions could be added, such as access methods for the Measurement object,
or testing in the constructor that the provided List really contains Measurement objects.
<p>

Via this interface, one can consider any arbitrarily complex choice of data values as
a vector, as long as you write a data provider that can determine how many elements there
are and how to access the i'th element.

If you don't want to write a whole class to implement the data provider interface,
you can use an anonymous inner class with the VectorDataAdapter class. For example:

<pre>
final List theData = myData;
VectorDataProvider p = new VectorDataAdapter() {
    public int size() {return theData.size();}
    public double getQuick(int index) {return ((Double)theData.get(index)).doubleValue();}
    public void setQuick(int index, double d) {theData.set(index, new Double(d));}
};
ReadOnlyMathVector vector = MathVectorFactory.makeReadOnlyVector(p);
</pre><p>

VectorDataAdapter implements the VectorDataProvider interface, so overriding it's methods
produces a suitable data provider. (This trick is commonly used for creating listeners
in user interface applications; see the appropriate section in the Java tutorial on
Swing for more examples.)
<hr>

Once an appropriate data provider is defined, a vector can be created with a call to a
method in MathVectorFactory:<p>

<code>
public void MathVector makeVector(VectorDataProvider p);<br>
</code><p>

For example:<p>

<code>
List measurements = getMyMeasurements();<br>
MathVector mVector = MathVectorFactory.makeVector(new MeasurementVectorDataProvider(measurements));<br>
</code><p>

In other words, after the data provider is written once, you can create MathVector views
of your data with a single line of code.<p>

<hr>

<h3>Read-only and read-write vectors</h3>

This package provides read-only vectors as well as normal read-write vectors. Read-only
vectors only provide access operations to the underlying data, but no operations that
would change the data. Normal vectors are a subclass of read-only vectors and additionally
provide methods that modify the underlying data structure. The class ReadOnlyMathVector
defines read-only vectors, while the subclass MathVector defines normal vectors.<p>

Like normal vectors, read-only vectors are created with a call to MathVectorFactory:<p>

<code>
public ReadOnlyMathVector makeReadOnlyVector(double[] d);<br>
public ReadOnlyMathVector makeReadOnlyVector(ReadOnlyVectorDataProvider p);<br>
</code><p>

As the second method suggests, there is an interface ReadOnlyVectorDataProvider that
is exactly like VectorDataProvider except that it doesn't include the setQuick method.
VectorDataProvider is a subinterface of ReadOnlyVectorDataProvider in the same way that
MathVector is a subclass of ReadOnlyMathVector.<p>

In other words, from a read-write data provider, you can create either a read-only
vector or a read-write vector. If, instead, the data provider is itself read-only, then
you can only create a read-only vector from it. Additionally, you can't convert a
read-only vector to a read-write vector except by copying the data. This allows you
to enforce read-only access to the data either at the provider level or at the
vector view.<p>

<hr>

<h3>Vector operations</h3>

Once you have a vector view of your data, ReadOnlyMathVector and MathVector define
various useful operations. Non-modifying operations like calculating the euclidean
magnitude or computing the dot product with another vector are defined in
ReadOnlyMathVector, while modifying operations such as normalization or adding
another vector are defined in MathVector. See the class documentation for these
classes for the full set of available operations.<p>
